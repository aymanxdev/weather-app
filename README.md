React weather app that fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and refreshes the data every 60 seconds. üï∞

## Getting started

- Sign up over at [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/appid) to get an API key.
- Fork the project and clone it locally.
- Create a file at the root of the project called `.env` with the following:

```sh
REACT_APP_OPEN_WEATHER_APP_ID = The API key you obtained from openweathermap.org
```

## What could be improved further:

If I had more time, I would get more creative with the styling and add more features to the app as follows:
1. Add a search input to check different cities, and get the Geo location of the user to get the current city‚Äôs weather

2. I will add an option to switch to between dark mode and light
3. Add animation to the cards
4. change the background based on the user‚Äôs time zone
5. Add accordion to the cards to toggle when clicked to show the forecast for every hour during that selected day
6. Change the loading bar to something more creative
